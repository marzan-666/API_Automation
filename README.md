# API_Automation
# The "Books" API app - building an API testing framework in Python

**Disclaimer**: 
This app is intended as a practice app for a testing workshop, so I took some shortcuts. ;-)


## Setup & installation

If you run into any issues with the steps below, please let me know at j19sch@gmail.com.

### Python and VirtualEnv
- Install Python 3.6 or higher
    - Instructions: https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/chapter_01/README.html (no need to install Geany or Sublime Text)
- Install virtualenv. Virtualenv allows you to create an isolated Python environment, with full control over which Python version to use and which Python packages to install.
    - If you have only Python 3 installed: `pip install --user virtualenv`. 
    - If you have Python 2 and Python 3 installed (likely if you use mac or linux), run `pip3 install --user virtualenv` instead.
    - If you need to figure out what you have installed, you can run `python --version` and/or `python3 --version` from the command line.

### Download this repo
- Download this repository by clicking the green `Code` button at the top (make sure you update to
the latest version right before the workshop) and unzip it. Or if you're familiar with git, fork this repository.

### Create and activate a Python virtual environment
We will be using this virtual environment both for running the test app, and for running the code your
write during the exercises.

- Open a terminal and go into the directory containing the repository files. Important: all commands in this README assume you are in this directory. 
- Create a virtual python environment
	- Note that this will create the virtual environment in the current directory, so double-check you are in the directory
	containing the files from the repository.
    - If you have only Python 3 installed: `python -m virtualenv venv`.
	- If you have both Python 2.7 and Python 3 installed: `python3 -m virtualenv -p python3 venv`.
- Activate the virtualenv (linux, mac: `source venv/bin/activate`) or (win: `venv\Scripts\activate`)
    - Note that once the virtual environment is active, `python` and `pip` will be the Python 3 versions, since that is how we set up the virtual environment.
    So for the rest of the instructions it doesn't matter if you also have Python 2 installed, since we run everything in our virtual Python 3 environment.
- Once you're done with the virtual environment (i.e. no longer want to play around with the code and the exercises), type `deactivate`
to deactivate it. Or close the terminal in which the virtual environment runs.

### Install the required libraries
Important: perform the steps below with your virtual environment activated.

- Open the `requirements.txt` and uncomment either the `gunicorn` or `waitress` line depending on your OS
- Install requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Running the app
Important: perform the steps below with your virtual environment activated.

- linux, mac: `gunicorn api_app.src.app` or win: `waitress-serve --port=8000 api_app.src.app:app`
- smoke test by using your browser to go to `localhost:8000/knockknock`
- the easiest way to restart the app is to kill the process (`ctrl/cmd+c`) and start it again

#### Docker
If you have Docker installed, you can also run the app in a Docker container:
- build: `docker build -f api_app/Dockerfile -t api-app .`
- run: `docker run -p 80:80 api-app`
- smoke test by using your browser to go to `localhost:80/knockknock`

### Advanced text editor
- Any advanced text editor with the following features will do:
    - syntax highlighting (easier to read)
    - word completion (avoids typos in names of variables, functions and methods)
- If you're note sure which one to use, Visual Studio Code is a good choice: https://code.visualstudio.com/
    - You can find VS Code's Python plugin here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python
    - To tell VS Code to use the interpreter in your virtual environment: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment
    - To enable autosave: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save 
- If you want more of an IDE, PyCharm is an great option:
    - To tell PyCharm to use the interpreter in your virtual environment: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html
    - To tell PyCharm to use pytest to run tests: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/pytest.html#enable-pytest
